Network Clipboard for Windows
=============================
This program allows you to share your clipboard text from your PC to your smartphone, 
when both are connected to your home LAN. Currently, there is no encryption in it, 
so don't use it to send sensitive information. For that reason, sharing of the
clipboard has to be requested explicitly by selecting "Send clipboard" in the system
tray icon contextual menu.

Also, checkout the Android client to make it work.
